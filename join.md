There is a wealth of opportunities to take part in Kube as a project and as a dedicated Open Source project we intend to give people in the wider open source community, developers and testers, the chance to work with us to improve the state of communication and collaboration in Open Source. For testers, the chance to have early access to the project and test its limits and for developers the challenge that an application the size and breadth of Kube can bring.
In this section you can find further information about Kube's technical aspects and find promising areas to work with.

## For Testers
Like any project, testing is critical and one way to participate in the project is to install and try the early version of Kube. [How to install a test version.]
You can try the latest development version using one of the following methods:
* Install the flatpak [Link to page explaining how that works exactly].
* Install a package from the obs [Link to the kolab obs].
* Build from source [Link to build instructions in kube docs.]

What to test, how to report the findings. (How to create a ticket in Phabricator) - Link to Phabricator (CHECK HOW IT WORKS)
